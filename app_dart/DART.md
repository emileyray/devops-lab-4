# Best Practices I Applied

* The project is broken down into different layers with incapsulated functionality
* A unit test is present
* A Markdown file is present
* Proper naming is used for functions and variables
* Camel case is used for naming
* Markdownlint is used
* Flutter lint is used
* const declaration is used wherever possible

## Flutter

* I chose Flutter because it's cross-platform and the most popular ui framework on dart.

    Pros:
  * **Hot Reload**: a feature that makes any changes the developers make in the code appear instantly in the app
  * **High Performance**: Flutter-based apps are very smooth in their performance which makes for great UX.
  * **Time saving**: Developing in Flutter is very fast and efficient
  
  Cons:
  * **Weighty**: The apps made with Flutter tend to have greater weight that native ones (not critical tho, so flutter is still the best, haters gonna hate)

## Linters

* flutter_lint is used for python

    built in the flutter framework

* Markdownlint is used for markdown files

    `ext install markdownlint` if VS Code is used
