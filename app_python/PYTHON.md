# Best Practices I Applied

* Python 3 is used as it's the last major version.
* A unit test is present
* A Markdown file is present
* Proper naming is used for functions and variables
* Snake case is used for naming
* Markdownlint is used
* Pylint is used

## Flask

* I chose Flask simply because it's popular and I'm new to web development on python

    Pros:
  * **Scalability**: the framework is simply designed and the project does not go messy as it gorws
  * **Lightweight**: as mentioned before, it's simply designed and not overloaded by too many features
  * **Documentation**: it has a user-firendly documentation
  
  Cons:
  * **Lack of tools**: it might be cool having a not overloaded frameworks, but some tools that are lacking might be necessary sometimes

## Linters

* PyLint is used for python

    `pip install pylint` to install

* Markdownlint is used for markdown files

    `ext install markdownlint` if VS Code is used

## Unit Tests

* Unit Test was provided in the first lab as one of the best practices was to include some tests

### Best Practices for Unit testing

* Test is as small as possible
* The test does not depend on the environment
* The test is readable
